**Stencila demonstration and discussion**

Join the [Stencila](https://stenci.la/) team for a demo and to discuss of the future of spreadsheets in research and data science. Though spreadsheets can be [quite problematic](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/one-five-genetics-papers-contains-errors-thanks-microsoft-excel), they persist. Stencila is an open source software aiming to make reproducible research more accessible to a greater range of researchers. We want to show you what we are building, but this session isn't about how we have solved the problems of spreadsheets with a new tool. We believe in collaborative software design and we are looking for the opinions, experiences, and ideas of people who work with data across fields of research. What is great about tabular data in a spreadsheet? What would you change to improve spreadsheet functionality and make spreadsheets less prone to human error?  Our goal is to build a great tool to improve research practices - please join us to share your perspective and input. 

Stencila is an open source project funded by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, under the umbrella of the Oregon-based non-profit [Code for Science & Society](https://codeforscience.org/).
